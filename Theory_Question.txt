1) Find the loop in the singly linked list:
   Add the on flag in node. Once you visited it make it 1. 
   For next node check is the flag set then loop available. Do for all node till NULL. 
   If you get null exit from loop and say there is no loop available.
   
   
2) Int value allocation for 64 bit and 32 machine.
  Int value is same for 32 and 64 bit machine as 4 byte. All data size is same on 64 and 32 bit machine.
  
3) 64 bit means data is 64 or Address.
    32 bit and 64 bit define the address line not data line. .. TODO

4) storage class
  auto,static,extern,register
  
5) volatile keyword
  volatile is a type qualifier not a storage class specifier

6) who allocate the size to variable compilar or system
7) Heap has limit
8) where heap size is declare
